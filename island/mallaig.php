					<p>Mallaig is a port situated in the Lochaber area, in the North West of Scotland. The port is connected to mainland scotland via the A830 road and the West Highland railway line. Mallaig was formed in 1840 by Lord Lovat, who wanted to turn the local area from farmland to a fishing wharf. The population quickly grew, especially with the introduction of railway in 20th century, with the population of Mallaig now at 660.</p>
