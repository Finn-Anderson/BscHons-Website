					<h1>Local Services</h1>
					<p>Facilities wise, because of the islands size, there is only a few things available. The island features a causeway and slipway on the port, so you can take vehicles onto the island. You can go on a walk around the island, go bird watching and/or fishing if that is your wish. There are also a holiday cottage and stores for you to visit.</p>
