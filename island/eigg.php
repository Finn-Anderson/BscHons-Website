					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>Standing with an area of 3,049 ha, Eigg is a product of the Eigg Lava Formation. At it's peak is a moorland plateau, which visitors can reach and see the beautiful view with all the other islands in it. 105 people currently live on the island, which has been a steady climb since the 65 that were on it in 2011. This is due to the island being community owned now, unlike the others.</p>
